🚗 Introducing Safarezy.com – A Smarter Way to Book Local Rides 🌐
I'm excited to share one of my most practical and impactful projects — https://safarezy.com – a web-based platform designed to make local transportation bookings faster, easier, and more transparent 🚕✨
🔧 What is Safarezy?
 Safarezy is an online ride booking system tailored especially for campus and local commutes. It's built with simplicity and accessibility in mind — whether you're a student needing a quick auto or a local user looking to pre-book transport easily.
💡 Key Features:
 ✅ Real-time availability of drivers
 ✅ Booking system with fare details
 ✅ Driver profiles with vehicle info
 ✅ Clean and responsive UI for mobile and desktop
 ✅ Built using PHP, MySQL, and modern frontend practices
🚀 What started as a college use-case project turned into a fully functioning web app — and taught me a ton about backend development, databases, UI/UX, and deploying user-centric platforms.

 This is just the beginning — more features like payment gateway, tracking, and admin panel are in the works!
